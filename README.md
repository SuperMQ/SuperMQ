SuperMQ
=======

Placeholder.  Brainstorm on the wiki.  In general, I want a simple, easy to use messaging system.  It should not require a rocket science degree to use, have a clean API and wire protocol, use best-in-breed for each platform for each fabric.  Basically, what I wanted RabbitMQ, ZeroMQ, and the like to be.

I'll put my money where my mouth is, and make my own, and see if i can do better.
